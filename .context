Project: PDF Viewer with Text Highlighting
Description: A FastAPI and React-based PDF viewer application that loads PDFs and highlights text regions based on coordinate data from a JSON file.

Key Files:
- static/app.js: Main JavaScript file handling PDF rendering and highlighting
- static/HLLY - Amendment no 1.pdf: Sample PDF file
- static/HLLY - Amendment no 1.json: Coordinate data for highlights

Technical Details:
1. PDF.js Configuration:
   - Scale: 1.5
   - Default PDF dimensions: 612x792 points
   - Viewport dimensions: 918x1188 (scaled)
   - Container dimensions: ~533x409

2. Coordinate Systems:
   - PDF space: Origin at bottom-left (0,0)
   - Screen space: Origin at top-left (0,0)
   - Example coordinate: (274.6066, 732.6672) → "ARTICLE I"

3. Transformation Solution:
```javascript
// Normalize to 0-1 range
normalizedX = pdfX / 612
normalizedY = pdfY / 792

// Convert to container space
screenX = normalizedX * containerWidth
screenY = (1 - normalizedY) * containerHeight
```

4. Key Implementation Details:
   - Uses container.getBoundingClientRect() for dynamic sizing
   - Maintains highlight position during window resizing
   - Properly scales highlight dimensions
   - Handles coordinate system conversion correctly

5. Debug Information:
   - Container/Canvas ratio: x≈0.58, y≈0.34
   - Example transformation: PDF(274.6, 732.7) → Screen(239.2, 30.7)

Common Issues:
1. Initial incorrect positioning (412,89) due to canvas vs container size mismatch
2. Coordinate system confusion between PDF and screen space
3. Scaling issues during window resize

Solution Verification:
1. Debug points appear in correct positions
2. Highlight maintains position relative to text
3. Proper scaling during window/container resizing

Dependencies:
- PDF.js v3.11.174
- FastAPI backend
- React frontend
